# Google_Advanced_Data_Analytics__Course_7_Project___Capstone_Project

The aim of this capstone project is to analyze data pertaining to a hypothetical corporations employees to determine what is driving churn.

With the acquired data, EDA was completed, visualizations to discover trends and infer patterns, statistical tests to further determine feature significant, and finally regression and tree-based models were developed.

The Logistic Regression model performed fairly well when predicting employees that will remain, but the scores were not as good for those that would churn. The tree-based models performed much better, particularly the second iteration of the Random Forest model once parameters were tuned, features were dropped and an additional one was engineered.

The conclusion of the analysis was that employees at Salifort Motors are overworked, leading to dissatisfaction and higher churn. The features associated with this appear to be hours worked, number of projects, evaluation score and less so, salary.

The recommendation is to put focus on improving the work culture by mitigating these factors, such as capping hours worked or rewarding those who work more hours, capping the number of projects, holding more frequent company meetings to discuss issues, and to look at high tenure employees and potentially looking at promotions.
